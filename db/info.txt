If the application is configured to use a sqlite db file, this is the default place to store those files.
By default it is configured to use a file in this folder named 'app.db'.
If this folder is empty when the 'flask db upgrade' command is run (assuming this is still the configured place for db files) then it will automatically create the file
This folder must be present when the 'flask db upgrade' command is run, or it will fail.
